Fast Social Share loads fast, works in all browsers and devices and allows you to add social networks yourself.

== Description ==

Fast Social Share uses customizable, static share buttons that work without any JavaScript or jQuery code. Thanks to that, it doesn't add any loading time to your site's pages. Moreover, thanks to its universal sharing method, it works for every browser and device your visitors may use to view your site. 

You can choose the placement of the share buttons inside your posts, you can customize their appearance, size and other features. You can use 'Follow us' widgets and invite your users to follow you in the social media accounts you have using widgets or inside the posts themselves. 

You can add any social network to the plugin from the plugin admin!
